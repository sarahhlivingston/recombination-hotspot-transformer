# recombination-hotspot-transformer
Model to predict Saccharomyces recombination hotspots. 

# Data 
The data for _S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. kudriavzevii_ is found in the main repository. The file paths in the Colab notebook must be updated to the correct file paths. 

# Model
The Colab notebook contains code for the Nucleotide transformer model for embedding extraction. This notebook contains the training loop for classifier training on _S.cerevisiae_ embeddings and evaluation on the remaining species.
